1. Multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1. Uses a while loop in order to accomplish this.

2. Simple for loop iteration in order to analyze, and convert the list of words into a dictionary with the desired analyzation.

3. Uses a fancy for loop in order to iterate through the list in a "parallel" fashion, calculating the powers, and storing them in another list in the process.

4. Simple DSA problem, uses a for loop and an if to compare the values with x.

5. Nothing fancy, this just calculates the percentage the smaller circle covers of the larger one. This is largely math based, but does use the Math package for pi.

6. Another fairly simple DSA problem, but I used a nested for loop implementation to iterate through and compare each elements of the list.

7. Simple time conversion, theres nothing fancy. The f string is used to round though.

8. This is just calculating the average value of each row and adding it as a new column in the pandas dataframe.
